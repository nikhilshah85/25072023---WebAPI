To make a call from server side / progamtically / safer calls

	we will use C#

	1. we need to have a POCO for the schema of data we are going to consume
		a class with proprties (getter and setter) for the data which will come

		eg. to comume this data - https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts
		we will create a class PostData and add 4 properties, user, id, title, body

	2. in the class have a variable of the data that going to come (single value, object, 		collection)

	List<PostData> pList = new List<PostData>(); --data will be captured here

	3. Create a method GetData (any name)
		public List<PostData> GetPostData()
		{
			//here we make a call useing HttpClient and return the data to controller
			//controller will give it to the view and display the data

			HttpClient client = new HttpClient();
				//clear the defaults
				//add JSON as incomieng data
			string url = "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts"

			var response = client.get(url);

			//start reading the data
			//we will need to install a nuget here - AspNet.WebAPi.Client 
	
			that's it 


		}
