				DI

	As a developer we create lots of object in applciation 
	but we do not write any code to destroy those object
		Destructor, IDisposable, atleast have finally block to relese the reference from memory ??

		because we think GC will take care of it
		Which is true. but it is not certain, when will GC do it ?


		so it is not reliable, especially in web application 
		finally it will on to the load on server which will affect performance

--------------------
	instead now on, it says that developer will not create any object, let runtime create the same, and runtime will also destroy the 	same	

	----
	we also have a need to share/reuse the objects in web applications (State Management)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		Thus there are 3 methods we need to configure 1 of them for our object

		1. Runtime will create and destroy the object when you configure the Entity as a service in 1 of the below methods
	
			a. AddTranscient - percall - runtime will create a new object for everycall it recieves and destroy that object when response 						     is released

			b. AddScoped - persession - runtime will create a new for every session (every user) - reuse the same object for all 					interactions - destroy the object when session gets over/times out/ logged out

			c. AddSingleTon - Application state - global object - object is created when server starts - same obj is used for all the 					request, users, sessions etcc.. obj gets destroyed when server stops / restarts


			use cases of above

			AddTranscient - when details/data/result is highly dynamic - eg.live cricket score, live stock market, live curreny exchange
			AddScoped - when details/data/result are user specific - eg.login to bankaccount
			AddSingleTon - when details/data/result are same for all users - eg. train time schedule, flight schedules, cricket score 						summary
