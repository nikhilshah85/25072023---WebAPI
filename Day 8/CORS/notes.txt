CORS :
	Cross Origin Resource Shareing
	
	API : http://www.cognizant.com/api/employees/list
	      http://localhost:8989/api/employees/list

		The above api is from cognizant and is running on their web server

--------
	Client

		http://www.clientname.com
		http://localhost:7584/home/displayemployees



	both are running on their own domains
	They are not allowed to get resources/data/details from other website

	bydefault they are blocked by a policy - Cross Origin Origin Resource Shareing
--------------------------------
	So what is to be done in such a case ?

	the api application will configure CORS service and a middleware in progam.cs

	3 step process
		a. add a nuget package CORS
		b. add a service in program.cs
		c. add a middleware in program.cs

		This is all you need to allow other sites to consume the api 


		For step 2, while configuring the service you can create policies (multiple policy as per need), where u can specify which client 
		domain will get access to which controller and which methods (limited methods only)

		eg.
		http://www.cognizantteamA.com (java app) = will get access to 
							GET, PUT methods only 
						and only on empcontroller, deptcontroller, clientcontroller , (not on accounts controller)
		http://www.icicibank.com (.net app) = will get access to
							GET method only
						and only on empcontroller and accounts controller
