			Data Access Technologies / Frameworks

		ADO.Net (very lenghty and lot of codeing - did not use any design pattern)

		ORM - Object Relational Mapping

			here all the objects from backend are mapped in frontend

			database --- DbContext 
			table    --- Class   
			columns  --- properties
			constraints --- data annotations
			procedures --- functions / methods

		very helpful for RAP - rapid application development
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Create a new database - add tables with some data 
2. Create a new API application - like everyday (this application has no idea about EF - thus we have to add Nuget packages for the same)
3. Install 4 nuget packages as below
	Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools
	Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design
	Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore
	Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer

4. Download POCO classes by running EF Core Command from tools - Scaffold-DbContext
5. Create an API controller with EF 
	it configures half dependency injection (half you have to configure)
	since we do not know what is DI - we will not use the first half

6. Instantiate a new object of DbContext - line 16
7. Comment the constructor
8. Build the applicaiton and run the application
